# CS348_Project
Our Project for CS 348


## Git Rules
- When making new changes, always make a branch (honor system cuz need pro version to inforce)
- When merging changes, create pull request for code review
  - Format pull request title to be clear statement of intent
- Try to keep pull requests kinda short/localized to one feature
  - Helps with debugging
  - If you are working on two things that don't directly rely on eachother, make 2 branches
